# Mapping Earthquake and Tectonic Activity
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use my knowledge of JavaScript, and geoJSON data using the d3.json and leaflet.js libraries to display multi-layered geographical map of the world that dynamically displays earthquake and tectonic plate data collected over the past seven days. Since this data is dynamicaly traversed and retieved the project visualization changes over time. 

## User Interaction with Multi-layer Map
Users may click on each circle marker representing an earthquake event to activate a popup that visualizes the location and magnitude of the earthquake event. Users may also interact with a legend in the upper right corner to select from a variety of geographical map views. And finally, there is a user input zoom in/out button in the upper left corner for viewing optimization.

## Results
The result is a visually stunning and user friendly layered geographical map of the past seven day's earthquake and tectonic plate data.
