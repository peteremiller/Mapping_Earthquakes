# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use my knowledge of JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data using d3.json to display three layered maps of the world that dynamically display earthquake and tectonic plate data from the past seven days. 

Users may click on each circle marker representing an earthquake event to activate a popup that visualizes location and magnitude of the event. Users may also interact with a legend in the upper right corner of the map to selcet from a variety of data views. And finally, there is a user input zoom in/out button in the upper left corner for viewing optimization.

The result is a visually stunning and user friendly layered map of the past seven day's earthquake and tectonic data.
